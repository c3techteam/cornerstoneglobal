Cornerstone Christian Centre Keffi started as a divine leading on 1st January 2017 and has since grown into hundreds with a yearly inflow and outflow of several scores of people owed to varsity graduation of the younger congregants which makes up nearly 90 percent of the church population. We have been called to reach the unreached, church the unchurched, and equip the saints for purposeful living. "we are a people of love without hypocrisy and ever prevalling faith."
